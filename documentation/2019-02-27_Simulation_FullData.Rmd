# The conceptual model

The underlying conceptual model that Mike proposes is

```
rate = [patient characteristics] + [physician characteristics] + [behavioral characteristics] + error
```

There are several things that are believed to contribute to the chance of getting
a knee transplant. First, let's consider some biology:

1. Severity of knee condition
  ~ This would look at the number of knee-related visits, using `koa_visits`, 
    `kneesymptom_visits` or `allkneevisits`. These might vary by year as the 
    knee conditions progress or improve. This might also be normalized with 
    time of follow-up to get an overall sense of severity. 

1. Demographics
  ~ Older people, or people of a certain race, may be differentially prone to get
  a transplant. This effect may be confounded by socio-economic status, rural/urban
  divide, or if they are poor.
  
1. Comorbidities
  ~ We might like to create a comorbidity score as the number of comorbidities
  present, with the idea that more morbid patients might be less likely to
  receive transplants. There may be an issue with recency of the comorbidity:
  `acutemi`, `afib`, `ckd`, `depress`,`diab`,`ulcers` are all measuring recent
  incidence, while the others reflect a history (ever happened). `hiv` might
  just be an issue anytime because of surgery, as will `stroke` and `liver`.
  Comorbidities (or hypochondria) severity might be indicated by `op_visits`,
  the number of outpatient visits the patient made. Obesity (`obese_wtperc`) is
  only available as an aggregate percentage in the HRR, so might be of limited
  value. It may also influence local physician/patient behavior, if one sees
  more obese patients or a relatively healthier population.

1. Proximity to death
  ~ If someone is about to die, they are more unlikely to get a transplant. This 
  can be quantified as odds of getting a transplant if patient died that year, 
  or the following year.
  
1. Previous transplant
  ~ Having one knee replacement should increase the risk that you get the other 
  knee replaced. 

Next, we'll look at physician/local characteristics that can influence the rate:

1. Local characteristics
  ~ 

The part we're interested here is in the physician characteristics, with the
behavioral characteristics being nuisance, in some sense. 

# Data description

The physician characteristics are obtained as aggregate ecological measures like

- Percentage with Medicare Advantage (`Mcare_adv_wtperc`)
- Density of orthopedic surgeions (`Ortho_per_100000`)

There are also some ecological measures for patient characteristics:

- % obesity (`obese_wtperc`)
- % with physical occupation (`physjob__wtperc`)
- % smokers (`smoking_wtperc`)

At the patient level we have

- Age (continuous, `age_at_end_ref_yr`, discrete, `agecat`)
- Gender (`Male`, 1=male, 0=female)
- Race (`Race`, categorized as 1=white, 2=black, 3=hispanic, 4=asian, 5=other)
- A listing of 20 comorbidities, as 0/1 variables
- knee OA visits (continuous, `koa_visits`, discrete, `koa`, 0/1)
- knee symptom visits (continous, `kneesymptom_visits`, discrete, `kneesymptoms`, 0/1)
- Total knee visits (continuous, `allkneevisits`, discrete, `knee_patient`, 0/1)
- Dead or alive (`dead`, 1 = dead in year)
- Time of followup during calendar year (`personyrs`, 0-1 yrs)
- Current year of observation (`bene_enrollmt_ref_yr`, 2011-2015)
- Poor or on Medicaid (`poor`, 0/1)

We also have two variables that are based on ZCTA's, rather than the actual 
HRR's

- Socio-economic status (`zscore`)
- Rural district (`rural`, 0/1)
