arthroplasty among Medicare beneficiaries age 65 to 89 in 2011-2015, by
Health Referral Region. Expected rates were based on models that
adjusted for age, sex, and race-ethnicity.

total knee arthroplasty among white Medicare beneficiaries with expected
rates based on the age- and sex-adjusted model, or based on the full
model that adjusted for age, sex, presence of knee symptoms, area-based
measures of obesity, smoking, and physically demanding occupations, 20
comorbid conditions, poverty, and area-based socioeconomic score.
Observed/expected ratios based on the full model were more concentrated
around 1.0 (kurtosis 0.079) than the age- and sex-adjusted model
(kurtosis 1.21).
