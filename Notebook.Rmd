# Introduction

This study seeks to understand why rates of primary knee replacements vary across geographical 
regions. There are 306 geographical regions in this study, with the rate of knee replacement varying
from 4/1000 to 14/1000. This study covers the years 2011-2015, for a total of 147M records (about 35M 
patients), with one record per person-year. 

Earlier studies have attempted to look at this data standardized for age, sex, and race, and 
have still found variability in the incidence rates. The tacit assumption that was made in earlier 
studies is that the rate of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is uniform across the country. 

The obvious criticism of earlier findings is that there are unmeasured confounders that would account
for the variability. This study attempts to incorporate many of the confounders to see if they can
account for the observed variability adequately. These confounders include comorbidities (affects the
risk of getting a replacement), healthcare utiliization variables (do people differ in going to the
doctor due to differences in access or attitudes), and physician attitudes (captured by % with Medicare
Avantage HMO, which can have spillover attitudinal effects on doctors, and availability of 
orthopedic surgeons).
